        A cocktail is a term relating to any type of alcoholic mixed drink. Most
        commonly, cocktails are either a combination of spirits, or one or more
        spirits mixed with other ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored
        syrup, or cream. Cocktails vary widely across regions of the world, and
        many websites publish both original recipes and their own
        interpretations of older and more famous cocktails.

        The origins of the word cocktail have been debated. The first written
        mention of cocktail as a beverage appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803
        in the United States. The first definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic
        beverage appeared three years later in The Balance and Columbian
        Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806.Traditionally, cocktail
        ingredients included spirits, sugar, water and bitters,however, this
        definition evolved throughout the 1800s, to include the addition of a
        liqueur.
        <br /> <br />
        In 1862 Jerry Thomas published a bartenders’ guide called How to Mix
        Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion which included 10 cocktail
        recipes using bitters to differentiate from other drinks such as punches
        and cobblers. Cocktails continued to evolve and gain popularity
        throughout the 1900s, and in 1917 the term "cocktail party" was coined
        by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. With wine and beer
        being less available during the Prohibition in the United States
        (1920–1933), liquor-based cocktails became more popular due to
        accessibility, followed by a decline in popularity during the late
        1960s. The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture through
        the style of mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and other novel
        ingredients.

        In the modern world and the Information Age, cocktail recipes are widely
        shared online on websites like Allrecipes.com and Food.com. Cocktails
        and restaurants that serve them are frequently covered and reviewed in
        tourism magazines and guides.Some cocktails, such as the Mojito,
        Manhattan, and Martini have become both staples in most restaurants and
        pop culture phenomenons, martinis specifically being associated with
        James Bond due to the Goldfinger phrase "shaken, not stirred". Contents{" "}
